90 Day Goals: 
Spend several hours looking over the semester project to get a better understanding for how larger solutions are put together
For my game, before the end of the semester: 
  Fix the collision bug (maintenance)
  Come up with some way to improve the game and implement it (maintenance)
  Document the process for both to show understanding
